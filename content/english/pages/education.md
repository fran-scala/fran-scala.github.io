### Master degree in Physics of Quantum Technologies 
**Università degli Studi di Pavia (2019-2021)**

My course of study has focused on quantum computing, quantum information and hardware implementation of these principles through quantum technologies. I also had the opportunity to deepen the field of machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. My master thesis that was focused on the application of quantum machine learning techniques in order to detect peculiar quantum features. 

Thesis: Witnessing Entanglement by Quantum Neural Networks   
Supervisors: Prof. Dario Gerace, Prof. Daniele Bajoni

### Bachelor degree in Physics 
**Università degli Studi di Pavia (2016-2019)**

Thesis: Machine learning techniques applied to the quantum many-body problem   
Supervisor: Prof. Dario Gerace   
Co-supervisor: Francesco Tacchino (Research Staff Member at IBM Research – Zurich)

### College life 
**Almo Collegio Borromeo**

[Almo Collegio Borromeo](http://www.collegioborromeo.it/it/it/), founded in 1561 by Carlo Borromeo, is a meritocratic university residence and is the oldest such institution remaining in operation in Italy. It is also a _highly qualified Cultural Institute_ by the Ministry of Universities and Research.
In order to become an _alumno_ you need to pass an admission test. The strict requirements to keep the status of student of the college are based on academic achievements (minimum GPA of 27/30) and extracurricular activities (at least 70 hours per year).

I have been an _alumno_ from 2016 to 2021. Apart from the academic requirements and the educational opportunities the this college provides, the are a lot of informal activities organized by the students for the students. In addition, in Pavia there other colleges that together orgazine tournaments and events. For example, I was in the football team and one of the main organizers of our annual college's party "[Festa di Primavera](https://www.facebook.com/festaborromeo2019/)".

All this things allowed me to form a strong bond of friendship with some of my college mates and made living at Almo Collegio Borromeo one of the best experiences of my life.
