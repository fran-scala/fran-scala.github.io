Two years ago, I began my venture into the world of Calisthenics, a form of exercise that utilizes bodyweight movements to build strength and flexibility. While I do not consider myself an expert in this discipline just yet, I've made significant strides in my abilities, and the progress I've achieved is truly motivating. Calisthenics demands dedication, patience, and consistent effort. I'm looking forward to see what the next years will bring as I continue to refine my skills. It's also a great way to free my mind and release any form of stress and tension.

At the moment I'm training to learn some skills like: <b>muscle up, free handstand</b> and <b>front lever</b>.

Here you can find some picture of me trying to look cool while training.
