Efficient ways to prepare Fermionic ground states on quantum computers are in high demand and different techniques ranging from variational to divide-and-conquer were developed over the last years. Despite having a vast set of methods it is still not clear which method performs well for which system. In this work, we combine interpretable circuit designs with a divide-and-conquer approach and show how this leads to explainable performance. We demonstrate that the developed methodology outperforms other divide-and-conquer methods in terms of size of the effective basis as well as individual quantum resources for the involved circuits.
